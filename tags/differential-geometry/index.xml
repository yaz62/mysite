&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This post shows how the calculus of variations connects two definitions of geodesics: as “straight lines” (parallel transport) and as distance-minimizing curves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to both the energy and length functionals, we see that minimizing energy requires constant-speed (affine) parametrization, while minimizing length is parametrization-invariant.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The result: a curve is a geodesic if its covariant acceleration is parallel to its tangent vector, generalizing the definition beyond constant-speed parametrization.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I usually explain geodesics to others based on two intuitions:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prove That Meridians Are Geodesics With LLMs</title><link>https://yaz62.github.io/posts/prove-meridians-are-geodesics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yaz62.github.io/posts/prove-meridians-are-geodesics/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I tried to prove that meridians on a surface of revolution are always geodesics, but my calculations suggested otherwise unless a certain condition was met.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I consulted ChatGPT and Claude; both initially gave confusing or circular reasoning, but Claude provided a clue that led me to the answer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The key insight: the geodesic equation requires the curve to be parametrized with constant speed (affine parametrization).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parallel transport preserves the length of the tangent vector, so the tangent must have constant speed along a geodesic.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The collaborative exploration with LLMs brought more satisfaction than just getting the answer directly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve learned bits of differential geometry over the years, and I always use Theodore Shifrin&amp;rsquo;s notes, &lt;em>Differential Geometry: A First Course in Curves and Surfaces&lt;/em>, as my textbook. Recently, I decided to pick it back up just for fun.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
